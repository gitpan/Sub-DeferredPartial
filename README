NAME

  Sub::DeferredPartial - Deferred evaluation / partial application

DESCRIPTION

  An instance of this class behaves like a sub (or, more precisely: subroutine
  reference), but it supports partial application and the evaluation of
  operators applied to such function objects is deferred too.
  That means, evaluation has to be forced explicitly (which makes it easier to
  add introspection capabilities).

  Objects that represent deferred (delayed, suspended) expressions are known
  as suspensions or thunks in various programming circles.
  Don't confuse with the same terms in the context of threads!
